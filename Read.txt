Following are the points on this particular project
->  Build a client that have two options
    - As a user I can open a channel and stream anything I want in that channel either Desktop streaming
    - Or I can upload a video and that can be streamed
        - To watch anything that I stream on my channel one needs to have a passcode 
    Other utility:

-> Make your own system a server which people can access over the internet initially


Services needs to be build:
-> Authentication service 
-> Channel Service
-> Video streming service 
-> Figure out how you can host the application in your own computer to the world in a safe way
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test the following constraints:
    How much load can your application take?
    How can you make things more efficient?
    What are the security risks of putting your system online if any?
    What are other security threats to such application and how you can protect it?


Starting with following tasks:
- Create Authentication system with login page
